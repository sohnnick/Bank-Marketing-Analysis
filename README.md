# Summary
Utilized chi-square and variance threshold for feature selection. Applied SMOTE to deal with classification imbalance, but recognized it does not necessarily yield the best predictor. Applied Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree classifier to the dataset. Further applied regularization and dimensionality reduction such as decision tree pruning, ridge regression, and lasso regression. Key metric for this dataset was precision for "yes" term-deposits since the business goal was related to maximizing term-deposits with respect to campaigns.
